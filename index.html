    <h1>Hi
    </h1>
    <div class = "line"> </div>
    <p>My hobby is reading. I read whenever I have free time. I read many kinds of book such as history books, science books, sometimes, it is novel and popular magazines. Reading has a lot of advantages. First, reading is a cheap way to get information and entertainment. Moreover, you can keep a book forever and read it many more times. Thus, reading is a convenient way for me to acquire a wonderful source of knowledge. Futhermore, reading book will contribute to my vocabulary expansion. The more I read, the more words I exposure to, and they will inevitably make their way to my mind. That, therefore, also helps to improves my memory. When I read a book, I have to remember its plot, characters' name, events so that my memory will become much better. Additionally, reading book is the best way to set my mind at rest after a hard and gruelling day. These are some reasons why I am so into reading. And I think, anyone always sticking with their computer should step away from it for a little while, crack a book and replenish their soul for a moment.</p>
